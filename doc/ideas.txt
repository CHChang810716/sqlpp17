No "dynamic_select" et al.
==========================
In sqlpp11, we can add tables dynamically to the right. We can combine conditions dynamically via AND.
In sqlpp17, we can anonymize tables/joins and expressions so that we can combine static and dynamic parts more fluently.

There will also be several versions of select: With a static tuple, or with a vector of variants of fields.

row.x should be a value/optional, not a complex object.
=======================================================
auto x = row.x leads to too many surprises

results.front() needs to throw is results.empty()
=================================================
It happens way too often that someone assumes that there is at least one result, when there isn't

Instead of having a "custom_statement", combine statements with operator<< or similar

Use braces only if needed, e.g. not for "x and y and z" but for "(x or y) and z". Same with +-*/.
